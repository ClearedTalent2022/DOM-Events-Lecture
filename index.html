    <h1>This is the DOM and Events Lecture Web Page</h1>

    <p>
        The DOM has a lot of layers to it.
        The first thing we need to focus on is the
        <strong>window</strong> object
    </p>

    <p id="redHoverText">
        Let's try to add JavaScript that changes the
        color of the text in this p tag to be red
        when we hover over it!
    </p>
